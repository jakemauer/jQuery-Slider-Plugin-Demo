# jQuery Slider Plugin

This plugin was written for and during the graduate GD web publishing course at MICA during the fall 2010 semester.

## Purpose

The main goal was to examine and step through the proper structure of a jQuery plugin, as well as exploring the usefulness it can provide in terms of code re-use. 

## Notes

This isn't an elegant or even really useful plugin. It needs a fair amount of polish before it would have a place in production code. I've put it here in the hopes it will spur me to continue working on it.
